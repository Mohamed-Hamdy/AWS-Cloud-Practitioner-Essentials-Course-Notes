## What is a client-server model?

You just learned more about AWS and how almost all of modern computing uses a basic client-server model. Let’s recap what a client-server model is

The **client-server model** is a computing structure where a **client** (like a web browser or app) sends requests to a **server**, which processes those requests and returns the appropriate data. For example, when you request a news article or video, the server—such as an AWS EC2 instance—responds with the content. This model underpins most modern computing and cloud services.

## **Deployment models for cloud computing**

There are **three main cloud deployment models**:

1. **Cloud-based deployment**:
    All resources (servers, databases, networking, etc.) are hosted in the cloud. Organizations can migrate existing apps or build new ones directly in the cloud using either low-level infrastructure or managed services.
2. **On-premises deployment (Private Cloud)**:
    Resources are deployed locally using virtualization and management tools. It’s ideal for companies needing more control or meeting strict data regulations, and resembles traditional IT with improved efficiency.
3. **Hybrid deployment**:
    Combines cloud and on-premises environments. Useful when some apps need to stay on-site (e.g., for compliance), while other workloads benefit from cloud services like data analytics or automation.
